2025-05 Update 
Looks like my local KFC has upped the price to $5.95. Looking at the surrounding suburbs, they still have it for $4.95. 
I wonder if this was because of how much I order, and the lower margins this product has?

zinger fillet, a beautifully well cooked schnitzel. Imagine being served one of these bad boys in a pub for $5.
