KFC will try anything rather than bring back the original krushers. Looks like they're rolling out a new drink range, with 4 categories: lemonades, boba refreshers, krunch shakes, and iced coffee krunch, ranging from $5.45 to $6.45.

Currently available at Warrawong, Dapto, Unanderra and Fairy Meadow and coming to Shellharbour, Shellharbour Food Court, Albion Park 2 and Wollongong Food Court â€” on May 6

The Krunch range could be decent... Caramel Krunch Shake - "A smooth caramel shake topped with biscuit crumbs.", Chocolate Krunch Shake - "A rich chocolate treat with a crunchy topping." and Mango Coconut Krunch Shake - "A tropical delight featuring shredded coconut."

I suspect it does not require the large chilling machine like the Krusher did, hence the willingness to bring it back.
