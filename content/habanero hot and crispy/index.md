Hot & Crispy, I suspect pretty much just scraps from more premium cuts of meat. No thanks. 

I wonder how, if it is scraps, they stitch / glue them together?

The sauce is interesting - I don't love spicy for the sake of it, but I'd give it a go. It's only available on Hot and Crispy, hence not for me. 

I'll review Hot & Crispy once the pie makes a return.
