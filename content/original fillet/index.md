In 2024, KFC changed the original fillet, looking something like the following:

into the "Cripsy Fillet" -

The fillet was superior in all ways, and I am unsure why KFC decided to make the switch. I wonder if they believed the marketing behind "crispy" is more appealing than "original", and potentially somewhat confusing with "Original Recipe" chicken. 

Given how mild the spicy with the Zinger, I'm not sure who the target market for this is. I'd love for them to bring the OG fillet back.
