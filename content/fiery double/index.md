Fiery Double - seems to be a slight modification to the Zingle Double - just with their "11 chillis" sauce. Hence should this review be for the whole product or just the sauce? 

An interesting attempt for KFC to bring something "new" to the market. I wonder if the added chilli sauce deters any of the potential customer base? I suspect most consumers - like myself - are de-sentised to KFCs "spicy" marketing and will believe it when we see it. This sauce is spicy for sure, but they could definetly go further with it. 

Otherwise the clear hero of this product is the Zinger Fillet, in fact the argument could be made that the additional ingredients actually make it an overwall worse product. 

Considering it's cheaper than 2 Zinger Fillets on their own $10.95 vs $11.90, and includes cheese, bacon etc, it's a better deal.
