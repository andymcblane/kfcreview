Fiery Double - found on the secret menu, seems to be a slight modification to the Zinger Double - just with their "11 chillis" sauce, hence should this review focus on the whole product or just the sauce?

An interesting attempt for KFC to bring something "new" to the market. I wonder if the added chilli sauce deters any of the potential customer base? I suspect most consumers - like myself - are desensitised to KFC's "spicy" marketing and will believe it when we see it. This sauce is spicy for sure, but they could definitely go further with it. 

Otherwise the clear hero of this product is the Zinger Fillet, in fact the argument could be made that the additional ingredients actually make it an overall worse product. 

Considering it's cheaper than 2 Zinger Fillets on their own $10.95 vs $11.90, and includes cheese, bacon etc, it's a better deal. 

Would buy it again, but this product alone wouldn't influence my decision to go to KFC or not. Worth a shot if you're interested how mild an 11 chilli sauce is.
